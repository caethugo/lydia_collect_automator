# Lydia collect automator

The goal of this repo is to define a function : 

-  taking a URL and a list of attributes as input
-  able to detect on the URL the presence of a lydia collect link, to open it, to complete the form with the given attribute and eventually to submit it. 

This would enable someone having the program to ensure his presence to all lydia collect events.
